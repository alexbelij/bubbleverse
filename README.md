# Bubbleverse (alpha) 
Bubbleverse is an incremental game in development. It is still in an early stage. 

## Play in your Browser 
Link: https://fionnfuchs.github.io/bubbleverse/ 
I have tested on Chrome and Firefox (68.2.0esr) and it works fine on these. 
**Warning: There is a known issue with Safari which "crashes" the game currently.** 

## How to play 
In Bubbleverse you grow bubbles in a tiny universe and collect them for cash. With the cash you can buy upgrades. Later it will be similar to incremental and idle games. Currently there is not that much to do.
 
### Controls 
- Click on bubbles to collect them 
- Click the spawn button to spawn new bubbles 
- UI should be relatively self explanatory 

## Roadmap 
**Itch.io Beta**

**Version 1.0** 
- At least 20 achievements 
- Offline progress
